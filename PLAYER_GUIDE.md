## ⬆️ Leveling & Progress

### How Leveling Works

Each character levels up independently using their specific tokens.

#### Level Requirements
Leveling up requires:
1. **Tokens** (increases each level)
2. **Coins** (increases each level)

**Formula:**
- Tokens needed: `Level * 50`
- Coins needed: `Level * 100`

**Examples:**
- Level 1→2: 50 tokens + 100 coins
- Level 2→3: 100 tokens + 200 coins
- Level 5→6: 250 tokens + 500 coins
- Level 10→11: 500 tokens + 1000 coins

#### Leveling Up Command
```
!levelup <character>
!lvlup <character>
```

**What happens:**
- Character level increases by 1
- Tokens and coins are consumed
- New token requirement is calculated
- Character gets stronger (higher max HP in future battles)

### Viewing Level Progress

Use `!char <name>` to see a beautiful visual progress bar showing your token collection progress!

**Example Display:**
```
🎫 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ **150/250** (60%)
```

This shows you're 60% of the way to your next level!

## 🎨 Skins & Customization

### Understanding Skins

Skins are **cosmetic appearances** for your characters that:
- Change how they look in your profile
- Display in battles and embeds
- Show your style and collection
- Don't affect stats or gameplay

Every character starts with the **default** skin.

### Viewing Available Skins
```
!skins <character>
```

Example: `!skins Nix`

Shows all skins available for that character (both owned and unowned).

### Equipping Skins
```
!equipskin <character> <skin_name>
```

Example: `!equipskin Nix galaxy`

**Requirements:**
- You must own the character
- You must own the skin
- Skin names are case-sensitive

### Profile Picture with Skins

When you set your profile picture, it uses your character's **currently equipped skin**!

**Example Workflow:**
1. `!equipskin Nix galaxy` - Equip the galaxy skin on Nix
2. `!setprofilepic Nix` - Set Nix as your profile picture
3. Your profile now shows Nix with the galaxy skin! ✨

### Getting New Skins

## 🧠 Advanced Strategies

### Optimal Leveling Strategy

1. **Focus on High ST Characters**
   - Characters with 80%+ ST have best HP
   - Prioritize leveling your strongest STs
   - Check ST with `!char <name>`

2. **Token Collection Priority**
   - Catch every drop you can
   - Focus on drops for characters you use
   - Trade for tokens you need

3. **Coin Management**
   - Save coins for high-level upgrades
   - Don't waste on low-impact levels
   - Keep emergency fund for shop items

### Battle Strategy

1. **Energy Management**
   - Don't waste energy early
   - Save for powerful special moves
   - Balance attacks and energy regen

2. **Status Effect Timing**
   - Apply burn/poison early for max damage
   - Save freeze/stun for enemy power moves
   - Heal during opponent's weak turns

3. **Item Usage**
   - Don't use items too early
   - Save revival tokens for close battles
   - Boosts are best used mid-battle

### Crate Opening Strategy

1. **Free Crates**
   - Open immediately (Bronze/Silver)
   - No reason to save them

2. **Premium Crates**
   - Save gems for Tyrant crates (best odds)
   - Only buy Legendary+ for characters
   - Open during events for bonus rewards

### Trading Strategy

1. **Know Character Values**
   - High ST characters = more valuable
   - Rare characters = premium prices
   - Level doesn't transfer much value

2. **Fair Trade Guidelines**
   - 80%+ ST ≈ 70-79% ST + coins
   - Gems are worth 10-15x coins
   - Rare characters worth 2-3 common ones

3. **What to Trade Away**
   - Duplicate characters
   - Low ST duplicates
   - Excess tokens for characters you don't use

### Event Winning Tips

**Trophy Hunt:**
- Battle during peak hours
- Use high-ST characters
- Don't battle when tilted (lose trophies!)

**Crate Master:**
- Save gems beforehand
- Open early to set the pace
- Watch leaderboard, adjust strategy

**Drop Catcher:**
- Set up notifications
- Stay active during event
- Practice typing drop codes fast
